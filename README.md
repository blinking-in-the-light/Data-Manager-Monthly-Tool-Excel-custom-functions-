# Data-Manager-Monthly-Tool-Excel-custom-functions-

I wrote these 4 modules to create a custom template for the Data Managers to use to track all the key metrics that are used to measure employee performance.

The Data Director uses this also, to see all teams in one place, compare to department totals, and track success against baselines. 

The functions combine to create what is essentially a pivot table from scratch, but have some built in translation.
